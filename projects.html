                    <p> A 10-day workshop where students learnt coding in Scratch and Python. The kids also warmed up to the usage of the Raspberry-Pi as mini processors and how a computer can interact with the enviroment in different ways. This invaluable experience made us understand the ways in which technological instruction could be delivered best to students.

                    <h4 class="project-loc" style="text-align:right"> Learning Center, Mundhwa, Pune</h4>
					<p> After designing a thorough curriculum using the knowledge gained from our prior experiences, we conducted a pilot workshop at our community center in Mundhwa. The kids coming to this center belong to nearby low-income communities in Keshav Nagar and Koregaon Park and had no significant interactions with computers in the past. In each session, the kids had to solve a real-life problem or complete a designated task. Both of these required them to design medium-level circuits using basic electronic devices (sensors, LEDs, buttons etc.) and use Python programming as a tool to interact with these devices. Their critical thinking and problem solving skills were put to test in every session and this was particularly evident with their final project ideas. The highlight of the workshop was when the kids designed a walking stick that could help the visually impaired using the devices they used during the workshop.

                    <h4 class="project-loc"> Ideal EMS, Hadapsar, Pune</h4>
					<p> Our first full-fledged workshop conducted at a low-income private school in the Hadapsar/ Sayyed-Nagar area. The workshop catered to around 60 students from Grade 9 who were divided into 2 batches. There were a total of 10 sessions over a span of 2 weeks for every batch; each session lasting 2 hours. Although the school did have a computer lab, it had been non-operational for the past 3-4 years and they had no formal teaching in computers. We recieved an overwhelming response from the kids and observed a significant rise in their understanding and comfortability with programming and electronics by the end of the workshop. The post-workshop survey revealed that around 90% kids want to learn more about computers and would consider a job in the technology sector in the future.  </p>
